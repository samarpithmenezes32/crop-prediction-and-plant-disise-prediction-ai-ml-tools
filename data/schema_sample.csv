# Column Descriptions:
# ------------------
# crop: Type of crop grown (Rice, Maize, Groundnut, Ragi, Wheat, Soybean, Cotton, etc.)
# soil_type: Soil classification (Lateritic, Alluvial, Black, Red, Sandy Loam)
# soil_pH: Soil pH level (range: 4.0 to 9.0)
# org_carbon: Organic carbon content in percentage (range: 0.1 to 3.0)
# N: Nitrogen content in kg/ha (range: 0 to 300)
# P: Phosphorus content in kg/ha (range: 0 to 200)
# K: Potassium content in kg/ha (range: 0 to 300)
# rainfall_monsoon_mm: Cumulative monsoon season rainfall in mm (range: 200 to 4000)
# rainy_days: Number of rainy days in the season (range: 0 to 150)
# avg_temp_season_c: Average temperature during growing season in Celsius (range: 15 to 40)
# dry_spell_days: Maximum consecutive dry days (range: 0 to 60)
# irrigation_access: Type of irrigation (None, Rain-fed, Canal, Tube-well, Drip)
# district: Geographic district name
# year: Year of cultivation (for temporal splitting)
# production_t: Total crop production in tonnes
# area_ha: Cultivated area in hectares

# Notes:
# ------
# 1. The target variable 'yield_t_ha' will be calculated as production_t / area_ha
# 2. Ensure no missing values in critical columns (crop, year, production_t, area_ha)
# 3. For temporal validation, train on years < 2023, test on years >= 2023
# 4. Rainfall should be aggregated for the specific crop growing season (e.g., Kharif: Jun-Oct)
# 5. Temperature should be the average for the growing period
# 6. Minimum recommended dataset size: 500-1000 samples for good model performance
